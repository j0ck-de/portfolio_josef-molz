      <p>
        My main experience is in front-end development but I also have a passion
        for design. Given that producing a modern website requires the
        combination of design, server technology, and the layer that users
        interacts with, I believe having experience in both design and
        development allows for making the most optimal user experiences. I was
        born in 1985 in Zwiesel, Bavarian Forest. After successfully completing
        my studies in media technology as a graduate engineer, I began my first
        professional experience in the field of marketing at the medium-sized
        company Kermi, in Plattling. During my almost 10 years as a marketing
        adviser in the area of application services I developed a special
        enthusiasm for programming and tried at every free opportunity to learn
        autodictactically webdevelopment. In the fall of 2020, I had decided to
        quit my current job as a marketing adviser and fully focus on web
        development. As a so-called career changer, it is my goal to gain a
        foothold in this industry to make a profession out of my passion. If you
        are interested in opening a door for me in your company, don't hesitate
        to contact me! I will take the first step through the door with
        motivation, enthusiasm and the constant will to learn. The second step
        will be the reward for your door gap.
